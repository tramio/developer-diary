*Biquotidien*. French adjective, "*occurring twice a day*".  
Two commits a day will thus be made to this repo: one to set daily objectives, one to record what was effectively done. 🟩

April 25, 2022 (½) — Planning to read the sections 3 to 8 from the React Hooks documentation + lay out my Memory Card's UI.  
April 25, 2022 (²⁄2) — Actually read the sections 3 (Using the State Hook) and 4 (Using the Effect Hook) from the React Hooks documentation.
